#### Database Initialization and Management

```python
def initDB(self):
    """
    Initialize the SQLite database for password history.
    """
    self.conn = sqlite3.connect("password_history.db")
    self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
    self.cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS history
                        (password TEXT, date_added TEXT)''')
    self.conn.commit()
    self.cleanupOldPasswords()
```

- **Purpose:** Sets up the SQLite database to store encrypted password histories, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
  
- **Process:**
  - **Connection:** Establishes a connection to `password_history.db`. If the file doesn't exist, SQLite creates it.
  - **Table Creation:** Creates a `history` table with `password` and `date_added` columns if it doesn't already exist.
  - **Data Cleanup:** Invokes `cleanupOldPasswords()` to enforce retention policies upon initialization.

#### Encryption Mechanism

```python
def initEncryption(self):
    """
    Initialize encryption for stored passwords.
    """
    try:
        # Check if encryption key exists
        with open(ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE, 'rb') as key_file:
            key = key_file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Generate a new key and save it
        key = Fernet.generate_key()
        with open(ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE, 'wb') as key_file:
            key_file.write(key)
    self.cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
```

- **Purpose:** Ensures that all stored passwords are encrypted, protecting them from unauthorized access.
  
- **Process:**
  - **Key Retrieval:** Attempts to read an existing encryption key from `encryption.key`.
  - **Key Generation:** If the key file doesn't exist, generates a new key using Fernet and saves it for future use.
  - **Cipher Suite Initialization:** Creates a `Fernet` instance with the retrieved or newly generated key for encryption and decryption operations.

#### Password Evaluation Logic

```python
def evaluatePassword(self, password):
    """
    Evaluate the password's strength and check if it meets policy requirements.
    Returns a tuple of (strength, feedback).
    """
    length = len(password)

    if length < self.minimum_length:
        strength = "Weak"
        feedback = f"Password is too short. It should be at least {self.minimum_length} characters long."
        return strength, feedback

    if length > self.maximum_length:
        strength = "Weak"
        feedback = f"Password is too long. It should be no more than {self.maximum_length} characters long."
        return strength, feedback

    # Check character requirements
    if self.require_uppercase and not re.search(r'[A-Z]', password):
        strength = "Weak"
        feedback = "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter."
        return strength, feedback

    if self.require_lowercase and not re.search(r'[a-z]', password):
        strength = "Weak"
        feedback = "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter."
        return strength, feedback

    if self.require_digits and not re.search(r'\d', password):
        strength = "Weak"
        feedback = "Password must contain at least one digit."
        return strength, feedback

    if self.require_special and not re.search(r'[^\w\s]', password):
        strength = "Weak"
        feedback = "Password must contain at least one special character."
        return strength, feedback

    # Calculate entropy for strength assessment
    entropy = self.calculateEntropy(password)
    if entropy < 50:
        strength = "Weak"
        feedback = "Password entropy is low. Consider adding more unique characters."
    elif entropy < 70:
        strength = "Moderate"
        feedback = "Password entropy is moderate. Adding more unique characters can enhance security."
    else:
        # Check if compromised
        if self.compromised_check_enabled:
            # Start a thread to check password
            self.thread = PasswordCheckThread(password)
            self.thread.result.connect(self.handlePasswordCheckResult)
            self.thread.start()
            strength = "Checking..."
            feedback = "Checking if the password has been compromised..."
        else:
            strength = "Strong"
            feedback = "Good job! Your password meets the policy requirements."

    return strength, feedback
```

- **Purpose:** Determines the strength of a password based on length, character composition, entropy, and optionally checks for compromises.
  
- **Evaluation Steps:**
  1. **Length Check:** Verifies if the password meets the minimum and does not exceed the maximum length.
  2. **Character Requirements:** Ensures inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters as per user settings.
  3. **Entropy Calculation:** Computes the entropy to assess complexity. Entropy thresholds categorize passwords into Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
  4. **Compromised Check:** If enabled, asynchronously verifies if the password has been exposed in data breaches.

- **Returns:** A tuple containing the password's strength category and corresponding feedback message.

##### User Feedback Messages

The **Password Quality Checker** application provides clear and actionable feedback based on the evaluation results of a user's password. Specifically, when the application checks if a password has been compromised using the **Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)** API, it displays distinct messages depending on whether the password is found in known data breaches.

###### **1. If the Password **Is Compromised****

**Displayed Messages:**

```
Password Strength: Compromised
This password has been found in data breaches X times. Please choose a different password.
```

- **Explanation:**
  - **Password Strength:** The label changes to "Compromised" to immediately alert the user that their password is not secure.
  - **Feedback Message:** Informs the user that the password has been exposed in data breaches **X** number of times (where **X** is the count retrieved from the HIBP API). It strongly recommends choosing a different, more secure password to enhance their account's security.

**Example Scenario:**

```
Password Strength: Compromised
This password has been found in data breaches 25 times. Please choose a different password.
```

###### **2. If the Password **Is Not Compromised****

**Displayed Messages:**

```
Password Strength: Strong
Good job! Your password meets the policy requirements.
```

- **Explanation:**
  - **Password Strength:** Remains labeled as "Strong," indicating that the password is both complex and has not been found in any known data breaches.
  - **Feedback Message:** Congratulates the user for selecting a secure password that adheres to the defined policy requirements, reinforcing positive behavior in password management.

**Example Scenario:**

```
Password Strength: Strong
Good job! Your password meets the policy requirements.
```

###### **Additional Context from the Application's Workflow**

1. **Initial Evaluation:**
   - When a user inputs a password, the application first evaluates its length and complexity based on user-defined policies (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of uppercase letters, digits, special characters).
   - If the password meets these initial criteria, the application calculates its entropy to assess its strength further.

2. **Compromised Password Check:**
   - If the password's entropy is high enough (indicating strong complexity) and the **Compromised Password Check** feature is enabled, the application initiates an asynchronous check against the HIBP API.
   - During this check, the user sees:
     ```
     Password Strength: Checking...
     Checking if the password has been compromised...
     ```

3. **Final Feedback:**
   - Based on the API's response, the application updates the feedback messages as outlined above, informing the user of the password's status.

###### **Handling Edge Cases**

- **API Rate Limiting or Network Issues:**
  - If the application encounters rate limiting (HTTP status code 429) or network-related errors while contacting the HIBP API, it handles these gracefully by informing the user that the compromise check couldn't be completed at that time.
  - **Possible Message:**
    ```
    Password Strength: Strong
    Unable to verify if the password has been compromised at this time. Please try again later.
    ```

- **Fallback Mechanism:**
  - In scenarios where password generation fails to produce a non-compromised password after multiple attempts, the application defaults to a fallback password (e.g., "P@ssw0rd!") and notifies the user accordingly.
  - **Possible Message:**
    ```
    Password Strength: Moderate
    Generated password has been assigned, but please consider creating a more unique password for enhanced security.
    ```

###### **Summary**

The **Password Quality Checker** is designed to provide users with immediate and clear feedback on their password's security status. By distinguishing between compromised and uncompromised passwords with specific messages, the application empowers users to make informed decisions, thereby enhancing their overall digital security posture.

If you have any further questions or need additional clarification on the application's functionalities, feel free to consult the **FAQ** or **Help** tabs within the application, or reach out to support at [ash.greer@go.stcloudstate.edu](mailto:ash.greer@go.stcloudstate.edu).

#### Password Generation

```python
def generateStrongPassword(self):
    """
    Generate a strong random password that meets the minimum length and is not compromised.
    """
    # Define character sets based on requirements
    character_sets = ''
    if self.require_uppercase:
        character_sets += string.ascii_uppercase
    if self.require_lowercase:
        character_sets += string.ascii_lowercase
    if self.require_digits:
        character_sets += string.digits
    if self.require_special:
        character_sets += string.punctuation

    password_length = max(self.minimum_length, 12)
    for _ in range(100):  # Limit attempts to prevent infinite loops
        password = ''.join(random.choice(character_sets) for _ in range(password_length))
        if not self.isCompromisedPasswordDirect(password):
            return password
    return "P@ssw0rd!"  # Fallback password if generation fails
```

- **Purpose:** Creates a secure, random password that adheres to user-defined policies and ensures it hasn't been compromised.
  
- **Process:**
  - **Character Set Construction:** Builds a pool of characters based on the enabled requirements (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
  - **Password Length Determination:** Ensures the generated password meets at least the minimum length, defaulting to 12 characters for enhanced security.
  - **Generation Loop:** Attempts up to 100 times to create a password that hasn't been compromised. If unsuccessful, defaults to a fallback password.

- **Fallback Mechanism:**
  - If the application cannot generate a unique, uncompromised password after 100 attempts, it assigns a default password (`"P@ssw0rd!"`) and notifies the user accordingly.

#### Password History Management

```python
def savePasswordHistory(self, password):
    """
    Save the generated password to the history database after encryption.
    """
    encrypted_password = self.encryptPassword(password)
    date_added = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    self.cursor.execute("INSERT INTO history (password, date_added) VALUES (?, ?)", (encrypted_password, date_added))
    self.conn.commit()

    # Enforce maximum history size
    self.cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM history")
    count = self.cursor.fetchone()[0]
    if count > self.max_history_size:
        # Delete oldest entries
        excess = count - self.max_history_size
        self.cursor.execute("DELETE FROM history WHERE rowid IN (SELECT rowid FROM history ORDER BY date_added ASC LIMIT ?)", (excess,))
        self.conn.commit()
```

- **Purpose:** Securely stores generated passwords in the database while respecting user-defined retention policies.
  
- **Process:**
  - **Encryption:** Encrypts the password using the established Fernet cipher before storage.
  - **Timestamping:** Records the exact date and time the password was added.
  - **Retention Enforcement:** Checks if the number of stored passwords exceeds the maximum history size. If so, deletes the oldest entries to maintain the limit.

#### Clipboard Functionality

```python
def copySuggestedPassword(self):
    """
    Copy the suggested password to the clipboard.
    """
    if hasattr(self, 'generated_password'):
        clipboard = QApplication.clipboard()
        clipboard.setText(self.generated_password)
        self.output_area.append("\nSuggested password copied to clipboard.")
    else:
        self.output_area.append("\nNo suggested password to copy.")
```

- **Purpose:** Provides users with a convenient way to copy suggested strong passwords directly to their clipboard for easy use.
  
- **Process:**
  - **Verification:** Checks if a suggested password (`generated_password`) exists.
  - **Clipboard Interaction:** Copies the password to the system clipboard using `QApplication.clipboard()`.
  - **Feedback:** Notifies the user of the successful copy operation or the absence of a suggestion.

#### Application Closure

```python
def closeEvent(self, event):
    """
    Ensure the database connection is closed when the application exits.
    """
    self.conn.close()
    event.accept()
```

- **Purpose:** Ensures that the SQLite database connection is properly closed when the application terminates, preventing potential data corruption or leaks.
  
- **Process:**
  - **Connection Closure:** Closes the database connection gracefully.
  - **Event Acceptance:** Proceeds with the application's closure process.
